# vicpets
This project was done as part of the udacity data science nano-degree. 
I work for a pet food company and thought it would be interesting to have a look at some pet trends in my home state of Victoria. 

I used several kaggle datasets for this project, notably

The libraries used were the typical pandas, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot. I also used the string library to clean up the text and seaborn for my visualizations
